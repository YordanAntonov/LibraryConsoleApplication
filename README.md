# LibraryConsoleApplication
 My first mini project to create console application

This application for now works without database, I will keep improving it with time, for now it has a few functions such as:
- Creating account to log in (Not serious login, will be improved in the future).
- Adding books
- Removing books
- Searching for books to read in your own library.
- Checking the whole library for read or books that you have not read.

Plans for future improvements:
- Adding database to the application.
- Will try to implement a way to check the books of another users.
- Transition the application to WebApp with ASP.NET
